I'm a first-year PhD student at Simon Fraser University, advised by Professor [Ke Li](http://www.sfu.ca/~keli/). My main interests lie in computer vision and in computational linguistics. I got my undergraduate degree at Cornell University, where I was advised by [Bharath Hariharan](http://home.bharathh.info/) and [Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/).
